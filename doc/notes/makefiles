Simpatico root directory:

setup         - rename current configure script.
configure     - reset options programmatically.
makefile      - Recursively descent src. Separate targets for html and tests.

src/
  makefile   -> Includes make/global.mk
                Recursively descends into subdirectories
make/
  README     -> explain what the other files are.
  global.mk  -> Defines directories (ROOT, SRC, BUILD, BIN) (modifiable)
                Define CXX_SERIAL, CXX_MPI
                Define MAKEDEP
                Define standard macros (SHELL, AR, etc.)
                Include compiler files
  gcc.mk     -> gnu compiler   (modifiable)
  intel.mk   -> intel compiler (modifiable)
  pscale.mk  -> intel compiler (modifiable)

util/
  defs.mk    -> Initializes and appends to UTIL_DEFINE and UTIL_SUFFIX.
                Define library name, using only util suffixes.
                Defines CXX as CXX_SERIAL or CXX_MPI, depending on UTIL_MPI
  rules.mk   -> Adds util/defs.mk as dependencies for all targets.
  sources.mk -> List of source files.
  makefile   -> Includes global.h, defs, rules, sources
             -> Other makefiles include src/compiler.mk, src/util/defs.mk 
                and src/util/rules.mk
mcMd/
  defs.mk    -> Includes util/defs.mk
                Initializes MCMD_DEFINE = UTIL_DEFINE and 
                            MCMD_SUFFIX = UTIL_SUFFIX
                Define library name, using util and mcMd suffixes.
  rules.mk   -> Includes src/make/compiler.mk and src/mcmd/defs.mk
             -> Adds util/defs.mk and mcMd/defs.mk as dependencies.
             -> Other makefiles include src/compiler.mk, src/mcMd/defs.mk 
                and src/mcMd/rules.mk
  sources.mk -> List of source files.
  makefile   -> Includes defs, rules, srcs

main/
  makefile   -> Includes compiler.mk mcmd/defs.mk, mcMd/rules.mk, 
                util/srcs.mk, mcMd/srcs.mk
             -> Define executable names, including util and mcmd suffixes.
