-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Stage #1: Use reverse communication for pair forces, and nothing else.
---------

 - Leave selection of ghosts in Exchanger unchanged. It's okay if we 
   send some unnecessary ghost - this should not effect correctness.

 - Leave covalent potentials unchanged: It's okay if we use reverse 
   update only for pairs, and repeat the force calculation for bonded
   interactions.

 - Unit test by adding tests that involves the pair potential to 
   ddMd/communicate/tests/ExchangerForceTest.h

   Done, tested.

Stage #2:
--------

 - Add velocityCommFlag, and allow for possible forward communication 
   of velocities.

 - Test DPD integrator

   Status: Not begun.

Stage #3: Reverse communication for bonded forces (if desired)
---------

 - Modify exchanger to keep covalent groups only on one processor.
   The group migrates with the "owner" atom.

 - Modify covalent potentials to calculate forces for all atoms in 
   Group, if forceCommFlag.

  Status: Not begun.

Stage #4:
---------

 - Suppress communication of (some) unnecesary nonbonded ghosts.

   Status: Not begun.
