Goal: 

Functions:

Add a new public member function Exchanger::initialExchange
to exchange atoms and covalent ghosts with less memory usage.

Add bool initial argument to private exchangeAtoms function 
to distinguish initial exchange from later. Initial exchange 
would not mark ghosts for sending based on group 
incompleteness.

The public initialExchange method would call private methods 
exchangeAtoms(bool initial = true) and a new method named
initialGhostExchange();

New function initialGhostExchange that would exchange covalent
ghosts with less memory usage, as described below:

Algorithm for initialGhostExchange::
------------------------------------------------------------
Step #1:

Loop over atoms to make ghost plans, using position alone.

Send all ghosts that are ghosts by position.

This could be copied from current exchange
------------------------------------------------------------
Step #2:

Identify incomplete groups and missing ghosts.

- Loop over all groups
  If the group is incomplete:

      Add group to list of incomplete groups
      Add ghost, but mark somehow as incomplete
      Add each missing atom id to request list for all directions

------------------------------------------------------------
Step #3:

Send requests:

For each of 26 directions:

   Send requestList

   Receive requestList

   for each atom in received requestList:

      if local, pack position and id for sending

   send buffer of ghosts to requester.

   Receive buffer of ghosts.
   
   Unpack, add ghosts to storage.

After all directions, iterate through incomplete groups,
confirm completion.

------------------------------------------------------------
Modification of Domain:

   Add member function to Domain that return const arrays 
   of ranks of neighbors to send to and to receive from for 
   communication over all neighbors:

   const FArray<int, 26>& neighborSendRanks();
   const FArray<int, 26>& neighborRecvRanks();

   Test loop over 26 communication directions (simple ping).
