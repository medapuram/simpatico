Identify incomplete groups and missing ghosts.

- Loop over all groups
  If the group is incomplete:

      Add group to list of incomplete groups
      Add ghost, but mark somehow as incomplete
      Add each missing atom id to request list for all directions

------------------------------------------------------------
Send requests:

For each of 26 directions:

   Send requestList

   Receive requestList

   for each atom in received requestList:

      if local, pack position and id for sending


   send back to requester.

   Receive ghostlist
   
   Unpack, add to storage. 

After all directions, iterate through incomplete groups.
