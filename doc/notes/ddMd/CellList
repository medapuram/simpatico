Proposals:
----------

->  Create different instances of Cell::OffsetArray for cells with different 
    distances from various boundaries.

->  For cells near a boundary, make separate Cell:OffsetArray objects for local 
    and ghost atoms.

->  In Cell::findNeighbors, pass separate localNeighbors and ghostNeighbors arrays.

->  In PairList, treat local-local and local-ghost pairs entirely separately.
