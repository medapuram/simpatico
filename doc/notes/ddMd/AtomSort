Proposal: Allow periodic sorting local atoms by the order in which they
appear in the cell list, ordering cells by conventional grid order. This
corresponds to the use of strips in construction of the pair list. 

Rationale/Comments:

1) There is not much point to sorting ghosts, because they are 
destroyed and recreated after each exchange.

2) Atoms can be sorted completely independently of ghosts because
they are stored in different instances of AtomArray.

3) Sorting of local atoms can be done immediately after atom and
ghost exchange(). This would require that we add all the new atoms
to the atomStorage() and reset all pointers to local atoms within
the groups.

Question: Is it possible or advisable to try to sort ghost atoms, since 
these are recreated after every reneighboring anyway? If we don't sort
the ghosts, much of the advantage of sorting is lost.

Question: Should sorting occur during the exchange, after exchanging atoms
but before exchanging ghosts, to minimize the cost of the sort?

What to sort, and when

  -------------------------------------------------------------

  Proposal 1) Sort all local and ghost atoms, after they all exist. 

  When: This could be done immediately after exchange. 

  Pro: Comparatively simple to program, separate from exchange.

  Con: The sorting of ghost atoms is pointless, since new
  memory addresses will be chosen during the next exchange.

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Proposal 2) Only sort local atoms.

  When: This would have to be done after private exchangeAtoms
  and before exchangeGhosts.

  Pro: Avoid pointless sorting of ghost atoms.

  Con: Requires careful integration with exchange operation.
  The communication plans calculated during exchangeAtoms would
  remain valid, and could be copied to new locations. The 
  pointers to local atoms added to the sendArray would, however,
  be invalidated by the sort. This is the main problem.

  Solution: Add bool "sort" parameter to exchangeAtoms and
  exchangeGhosts. If bool is true, don't add atoms to the send 
  list in exchangeAtoms, and do add them in exchangeGhosts.

------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithm:

   - Proposed functions for AtomArray:

        void addGroupExchanger(GroupExchanger& exchanger);

        void AtomArray::sort(Array<Atom*>& sequence, 
                             AtomStorage& atomStorage);

        The sequence would be an array of pointers to local 
        atoms in the desired order.

   - Copy all local atom data to new arrays, from bottom. 

   - Swap array addresses.

   - Clear all local atoms from the AtomStorage, and add back
     new pointers.

   - For each registered GroupExchanger, reset all Atom* 
     pointers in groups.
