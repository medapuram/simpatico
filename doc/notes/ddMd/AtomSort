Possible ways to sort atoms:
----------------------------

1) Sort by cells, in conventional order.

2) Sort by cells, in order cells are accessed during pairlist 
   construction

3) Sort by order atoms are accessed when reading the pairlist.

Ways to improve sequencing of cells
-----------------------------------

1) Hilbert curve

2) Blocks of cells, each explored exhaustively.

3) Layers (does it already do this?)

   Question: Can three layers fit in L1 cache simultaneously?

   Example: 32,000 particles over 8 processors, 4k each.

   4000*64 = 256k - larger than typical L1 data cache.
