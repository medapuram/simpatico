Classes for keeping track of molecules and atoms within molecules 
in the single-processor analysis framework.

SpSpecies (or data could be held by Simulation)

   capacity = maximum # of molecules
   size     = number of molecules
   nAtom    = number of atoms per molecule

   array of molecule objects (independently allocated by each Species)

   array of Atom* pointers? (memory pool for pointers)

SpMolecule:

   pointer to SpSpecies

   pointer to array of SpAtom objects, indexed by atom id.

   -> Allocate a pool of space for Atom* pointers for each species, and 
      have each molecule point to a sub-block.

   Groups (deal with this later):

   could later add pointers to array of group objects

   Might be helpful to have local group ids. Or we could place a 
   constraint on the ordering of existing group ids.
