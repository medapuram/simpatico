Observations: 

1) Each GroupStorage containers is used only to calculate an associated
   potential contribution.

2) Additional specialized potential might require additional data 
   structures (e.g., impropers, angle-dependent H bonding forces, etc.)

3) It would be preferable to have each potential responsible for 
   controlling communication of group-like data structures it requires.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideas:

1) Make each GroupStorage a member of the associated potential.

2) Create a more abstract interface for GroupStorage, to allow use in
   other potentials and generic interface for config file Io.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan (order of changes):

1) Create a GroupReference class as a generic group type for use by
   GroupExchanger, GroupDistributor and GroupCollector (not begun).

2) Modify GroupExchanger and GroupStorage classes to provide
   functions that provide GroupReference objects.

   - See GroupReference files for details

3) Modify GroupDistributor and GroupCollector to use the new class
   in implementation and interface. Change from templates to concrete 
   classes.

3) Modify ConfigIos to use the new interfaces of GroupDistributor and
   GroupCollector.

  - See GroupReference ConfigIos file for required interfaces of 
    GroupCollector and GroupDistributor, as used in a ConfigIo.

4) Move GroupStorage to be a member of the corresponding Potential.
