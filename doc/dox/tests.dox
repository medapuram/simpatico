/*! \page test_page Unit Tests

The tests/ directory contains a set of unit tests.  The tests/test 
directory contains the source code for a simple unit test framework that 
is used to construct all of the actual unit tests. This framework can be 
used to test classes that rely on MPI for inter-processor communication 
as well as classes that can be tested on single processors. Documentation 
for the test framework is provided within the header files in the 
tests/test directory, and in several examples in the tests/test/examples 
directory.

Actual unit tests are located in other subdirectories of the tests/, 
using a directory structure analogous to that of the src/ directory.
Tests of the classes defined in the src/util, src/inter, src/mcMd, and
src/ddMd directories are located in the tests/util, tests/inter, tests/mcMd
and tests/ddMd directories, respectively. These unit tests are not compiled 
by the set of makefiles that compiles the classes in the src/ directory.
Unit tests may instead be compiled separately by invoking "make all" 
from the subdirectory containing a particular test. This generally 
creates an executable, of named named "Test", that runs all of the tests 
in that directory.
