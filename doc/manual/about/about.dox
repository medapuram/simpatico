Simpatico is a library of C++ classes and programs for Monte Carlo (MC), molecular dynamics (MD), and hybrid MC simulations of molecular and polymer liquids.  It has thus far been used to simulate coarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer liquids, but is adaptable to a much wider range of problems. It contains the following main programs:

- Programs for MC and MD simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

- A program for parallel domain-decomposition MD simulations, named ddSim.

The single-processor programs mcSim and mdSim can also execute multi-processor algorithms, such as replica-exchange, in which each processor simulates a different system.
