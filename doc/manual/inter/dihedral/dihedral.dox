/*! \page inter_dihedral_page 2.7.3 Dihedral Interactions

Each of the dihedral interaction classes defines a potential that depends
upon the dihedral angle involving two bonds that connect four atoms. Each 
such group of atoms is assigned an dihedral type index, and different 
values of the parameters in the dihedral potential function are used for 
different dihedral types.

All of the dihedral interaction classes implement a common interface, which 
is described \subpage inter_dihedral_interface_page "here".

Let the three atoms in an dihedral group be labelled 0, 1, 2, 3, with bonds
connecting 0-1 and 1-2.  Let \f${\bf r}_{i}\f$ be the position vector for atom 
i, with \f$0 \leq i < 3\f$. We define three bond vectors
\f[
   {\bf b}_{1} \equiv {\bf r}_{1} - {\bf r}_{0}
   \quad\quad\quad
   {\bf b}_{2} \equiv {\bf r}_{2} - {\bf r}_{1}
   \quad\quad\quad
   {\bf b}_{3} \equiv {\bf r}_{3} - {\bf r}_{2}
\f]
The dihedral potentials are all function of the dihedral angle \f$\phi\f$.
This angle \f$\phi\f$ is the angle between 
the plane spanned by \f${\bf b}_{1}\f$ and \f${\bf b}_{2}\f$
the plane spanned by \f${\bf b}_{2}\f$ and \f${\bf b}_{3}\f$.
It is defined so that a planar cis configuration corresponds to \f$\phi = 0\f$, 
and a trans zigzag configuration corresponds to \f$\phi = \pi \f$. A more
explicit expression for \f$\cos(\phi)\f$ is given in \ref Inter_Dihedral_Module.
