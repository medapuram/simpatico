The LJPair interaction (pairstyle LJPair) implements a cutoff and 
shifted Lennard-Jones interaction.  The potential energy \f$V(r)\f$ 
for a pair of nonbonded particles separated by a distance \f$r\f$ 
is given for each pair of atoms types by a function 
\f[
   V(r) = \epsilon \left [ 
          \left ( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right )^{12}
          - \left ( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right )^{6}
          \right ] + S
\f]
for all \f$ r < r_{c} \f$, and vanishes (\f$V(r) = 0\f$) for 
all \f$r\f$ greater than the cutoff distance \f$r_{c}\f$.  The 
constant \f$S\f$ is chosen for each pair of atom types such 
that \f$V(r_c) = 0\f$.  Different values are defined for the 
parameters \f$\epsilon\f$, \f$\sigma\f$ and \f$r_{c}\f$ for 
each distinct pair of monomer types \f$i\f$ and \f$j\f$.  

Values of the parameters \f$\epsilon\f$, \f$\sigma\f$, and \f$r_{c}\f$ 
are denoted in the parameter file and source code by matrix-valued 
variables named "epsilon", "sigma", and "cutoff", respectively. 

The parameter file format is:
\code
   epsilon  Matrix<float>
   sigma    Matrix<float>
   cutoff   Matrix<float>
\endcode
All three parameter matrices are symmetric, and are entered 
in lower diagonal form. For example, for a system with two types 
of monomer, we might have:
\code
   epsilon   1.0   
             1.5      1.0
   sigma     1.0
             1. 0     1.0
   cutoff    1.122
             1.122    1.12
\endcode
The value of \f$r_{c}/sigma = 1.122 = 2^{1/6}\f$ used in the above
yields a so-called Weeks-Chandler-Anderson potential, which is a 
purely-repulsive potential that is obtained by cutting off the LJ
potential at its minimimum and shifting the potential to obtain
$V(r) = 0$ at the cutoff.
