The tests/ directory contains a set of unit tests of individual classes. The directory structure is as follows:
\code
   tests/util  tests of classes in src/util
   tests/inter tests of classes in src/inter
   tests/mcMd  tests of classes in src/mcMd
   tests/ddMd  tests of classes in src/ddMd
   tests/test  source code for unit test framework
\endcode 
All of the actual unit tests in the first four subdirectories of this list are implemented using a simple unit test framework. As noted above, the source code for the test framework is in the last subdirectory, tests/test.

Documentation for the test framework is provided within the header files in the tests/test directory, and in several examples in the tests/test/examples directory.  One distinguishing feature of the test framework is that it can be used to test classes that rely on MPI for inter-processor communication, as well 
as classes that can be tested on single processors. 

The unit tests are not compiled by the set of makefiles that compiles the classes in the src/ directory.  Unit tests may instead be compiled separately by invoking "make all" from the subdirectory containing a particular test. This generally creates an executable, of named named "Test", that runs all of the tests in that directory. Some directories contain a separate makefile target to build an executable for tests that require MPI, often called MpiTest.
