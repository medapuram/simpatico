   * of the object to which it points when the ScopedPtr goes out of scope. 
   * It accepts ownership of a built-in pointer either upon construction or by 
   * the reset() method, and deletes the associated object in its destructor.
   * A ScopedPtr cannot be copy constructed or assigned.
   *
   * Similar to boost::scoped_ptr, with minor differences. It takes the same
   * amount of memory as a built-in pointer, and should be equally fast.
