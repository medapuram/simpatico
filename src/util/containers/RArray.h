   /**
   * An Array that acts as a reference to another Array or C array.
   *
   * An RArray is associated with a "target" DArray or C array by the 
   * associate() method. The RArray and its target array then wrap 
   * the same underlying C array, and so access the same data. The
   * associate() method simply copies the address and capacity of 
   * a C array. An RArray can be associated only once, 
   * after which it can be safely used as an alias for its target.
   *
   * An RArray can only be associated with a DArray after the target
   * DArray has been allocated. Because a DArray can be allocated 
   * only once, this association cannot be corrupted by re-allocation 
   * or re-sizing of the target DArray. 
   *
   * An RArray can be created from another RArray only after the
   * target RArray has already been associated with some other Array.
   *
   * An RArray differs from a C++ reference to an Array because a
   * C++ reference must be initialized when it is instantiated,
   * whereas an RArray is associated after it is instantiated.
   * Because association is implemented by copying the address and 
   * capacity of a shared C array, access through an RArray should 
   * be exactly as efficient as access through a DArray.
