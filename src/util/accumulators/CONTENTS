The classes in this directory implement statistical accumulators that are useful
for data analysis.

  Average<Data>                  - evaluates block and global averages, 
                                   variance, and error for a sequence of
                                   Data values.

  AutoCorr<Data, Product>        - evaluates an autocorrelation function for 
                                   a single sequence of Data values.

  AutoCorrArray<Data, Product>   - evaluates an autocorrelation function for 
                                   an ensemble of equivalent sequences of 
                                   Data values.

  MeanSqDispArray<Data>          - evaluates mean-square displacement for an 
                                   ensemble of equivalent sequences of Data 
                                   values.

  Distribution                   - accumulates a histogram of values for a 
                                   double precision variable.

  IntDistribution                - accumulates a histogram for an integer 
                                   variable.

  RadialDistribution             - accumulates a histogram of particle
                                   separations in a material.

In class templates Average, AutoCorr, AutoCorrArray, and MeanSqDispArray, 
the Data template parameter may be a floating point type (float or double), 
a complex type (complex<float> or complex<double>) or a Vector.

The Product parameter in the templates AutoCorr and AutoCorrArray is 
the type for an inner product of two Data values. We require that 
Product be float, double, complex<float>, complex<double> or double 
when Data is float, double, complex<float>, complex<double> or Vector, 
respectively. The inner product a*b is defined as a simple multiplication 
for real values, as a dot product for Vectors, and conjg(a)*b when a and 
b are complex. These definitions are implemented by a set of overloaded 
functions defined in the file product.h.

In the implementation of MeanSqDispArray, the square difference of two Data 
values is a double precision number that is defined for floating point, 
complex, and Vector Data types by the explicit specializations of the 
sqDiff() method.
