Improve Extensibility
---------------------

- Make factory *.cpp files configurable (make _r versions)

- In modules, add protected methods to add subfactories.

- Document various ways of adding new classes to factories.

Angles and Dihedrals
--------------------

- Write and test HarmonicAngle class.

- Write and test MultiHarmonicDihedral class.

- Switch macros from, e.g., ifdef INTER_ANGLE to ifndef INTER_NO_ANGLE

- Change examples accordingly to work with code with everything enabled.

Constant Pressure MD (Jens)
---------------------------

- Port and test NptIntegrator subclass from DdMd.

Non-Orthorhombic Boundaries
---------------------------

- Use new applyShift method in MSD diagnostic classes.

- Find other uses of Boundary::lengths in McMd namespace.
  Add tests to cause crash before misuse, as needed.

- Add Boundary::isOrthorhombic test other classes that require 
  orthorhombic boundaries.

- Add tests for CellList specifically for Monoclinic Boundary.

- Make an example in a Monoclinic cell and try running it with 
  mdSim and mcSim.

Deformable Boundaries
---------------------

- Generalize snapshot and obsolete pair list methods to use
  miniminumDeformRatio to deal optimally with MD in deforming 
  boundaries.

Serialization
-------------

- Create ability to do true binary serialization, without single restart 
  file for each processor. Required changes in Util namespace are discussed
  in src/util/TODO. Required changes in McMd namespace include:

  - Create binary serialize methods for all objects created by factories.
    Base class methods should just throw exceptions.

  - Create serialization method (serialize or save and load) for Simulation
    that initialize all pointers after allocating all arrays, as done during
    readParam.

  - Make sure that loading methods explicitly creates required associations 
    between child objects.

Python File Tools
-----------------

- Tools for manipulating files and directories. We need scripts to:

  * Create standard directory structures for serial or parallel jobs.
  * Copy config and param files into a newly created directory structure.
  * Copy and move files to continue a run.

Testing
-------

- Test SET commands in command script.

- Add capacity for regression tests, using comparison to old files.

- More thorough tests of dihedral potentials.

Interface changes
------------------

- If possible, remove moleculeId() and molecule(speciesId, moleculeId)
  methods of System.

SystemAccess base classes
--------------------------

- Rename SubSystem SystemAccess

- Define McSystemAccess and MdSystemAccess classes with potential energy accessors.

- Derive diagnostics from a public Diagnostic and a protected (Mc|Md)SystemAccess.

- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in diagnostics that are
  derived from a SystemAccess class.

- Derive SystemMcMove from a protected McSystemAccess.

- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in mcMoves.

- Derive MdIntegrator from a protected MdSystemAccess.

- Remove replace system().typePotential() by typePotential() in mdIntegrators


Interactions (Design Changes)
-----------------------------

Interactions:

- Make Interaction class apply to only one choice of type index / indices.
  Potential class would then hold an array of Interactions.

- Create << and >> operators for each Interaction class. 

- Change file format to read typeId (ids) << Interaction.

- Add a constructor to each potential that takes an Interaction as an
  argument.
