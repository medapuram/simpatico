The directory tree rooted at src/mcMd contains all of the classes in the 
McMd namespace. 

Subdirectories:
----------------------

chemistry      classes for atoms, molecules, and covalent groups (bonds, etc.)
species        molecular species (i.e., molecular structures)
potentials     classes that evaluate potential energies and forces
  pair         nonbonded pair potentials
  bond         covalent bond potentials 
  angle        covalent three-body angle potentials
  dihedral     covalent four-body dihedral potentials
  link         mutable covalent bond potentials (e.g., crosslinks)
  external     external one-body potentials.
neighbor       classes that implement a cell list and a Verlet pair list
links          classes to manage crosslinks (mutable covalent bonds).
tethers        classes to manage tethers that constrain specific atoms
ensembles      classes that define statistical ensembles
simulation     main classes for constructing simulations
mcSimulation   Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation and System subclasses
mcMoves        classes for specific MC moves (derived from McMove)
mdSimulation   molecular dynamics (MD) Simulation and System subclasses
mdIntegrators  classes for specific MD integrators (derived from MdIntegrator)
diagnostics    classes for data analysis (derived from Diagnostic)
configIos      classes for configuration file IO in non-default formats
trajectoryIos  classes for MD trajectory (multi-configuration) file IO.
perturb        class for free energy perturbation theory
misc           miscellaneous utilities

Makefile targets 
----------------

The mcMd directory contains a makefile that can be used to compile all of the 
classes in the directory tree rooted at mcMd. This includes all of the classes 
in the McMd namespace.  The most important targets are available:

make all      make all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories, 
              a static library mcMd<suffix>.a in lib/, and the two
              executables mdSim<suffix> and mcSim<suffix> in bin/.

make clean    remove all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories,
              the static library file, and the two executables.
