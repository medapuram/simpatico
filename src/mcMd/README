The directory tree rooted at src/mcMd contains all of the classes in the 
McMd namespace. 

Subdirectories:
----------------------

chemistry      atoms, molecules, and covalent groups (bonds, etc.)
species        molecular species (i.e., molecular structures)
potentials     classes to evaluate potential energies and forces
  pair         nonbonded pair potentials
  bond         covalent bond potentials 
  angle        covalent three-body angle potentials
  dihedral     covalent four-body dihedral potentials
  link         mutable covalent bond potentials (e.g., crosslinks)
  external     external one-body potentials.
neighbor       cell list and Verlet pair list classes
links          management of crosslinks (mutable covalent bonds).
ensembles      classes that define statistical ensembles
simulation     main classes for constructing simulations
mcSimulation   Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation and System subclasses
mcMoves        classes for specific MC moves (derived from McMove)
mdSimulation   molecular dynamics (MD) Simulation and System subclasses
mdIntegrators  specific MD integrators (derived from MdIntegrator)
diagnostics    data analysis (classes derived from Diagnostic)
configIos      configuration file IO 
trajectoryIos  MD trajectory (multi-configuration) file IO.

misc           miscellaneous utilities

Makefile targets 
----------------

The mcMd directory contains a makefile that can be used to compile all of 
the classes in the directory tree rooted at mcMd. This includes all of the
classes in the McMd namespace.  The most important targets are:

make all      make all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories, 
              a static library mcMd<suffix>.a in lib/, and the two
              executables mdSim<suffix> and mcSim<suffix> in bin/.

make clean    remove all *.o files in src/mcMd and its subdirectories, 
              the static library file, and the two executables.
