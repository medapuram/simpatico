The MultiHarmonicDihedral interaction implements a potential that can be
expressed as a Fourier expansion of the dihedral angle \f$\phi\f$ defined 
in \ref Inter_Dihedral_Module. The energy is given by
\f[
   V(\phi) = K_{0} + \sum_{m=1}^{4} K_{m} \cos(m\phi) 
\f]
The parameter file format is a set of rows, in which each row contains a
dihedral type index followed by values of K0, ..., K4 for a particular
dihedral type. The format is thus
\code
   0    K0   K1   K2  K3   K4
   1    K0   K1   K2  K3   K4 
   ....
\endcode
The first integer in each line is a type index. Different dihedral types 
must appear in order sequential order 0, 1, 2, etc.
