The classes in subdirectories of src/inter define potential energy functions
(interactions) for individual nonbonded-pairs, bonds, angles, etc. These are 
used by both the single-processor programs in src/mcMd and the parallel MD 
program in ddMd/.


Subdirectories:
---------------

pair           non-bonded pair interactions
bond           covalent bond interactions
angle          covalent angle (3-body) interactions
dihedral       covalent dihedral (4-body) interactions
external       external 1-body interactions
user           place for new interactions that are not under repostory control
tests          unit tests

Makefile targets:
-----------------

The makefile in src/inter may be used to perform an in source compilation of all
the classes in src/inter. The main makefile targets are:

make all       compile all source files in src/inter and build a static library
make clean     remove all files generated by make all
