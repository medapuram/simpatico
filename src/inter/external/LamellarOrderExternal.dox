The LamellarOrderExternal interaction implements an external potential that 
was designed to induced layering in block copolymer liquid. The potential
energy is a periodic function of the coordinate x along one of the three 
direction orthogonal directions of an orthorhombic.  The function 
\f$V_{i}(x)\f$ for atoms of type \f$i\f$ is taken to be of the form
\f[
   V_{i}(x) = \lambda A_{i} \tanh \left ( \frac{1}{WqL} \cos( qx ) \right)
\f]
with
\f[
   q = \frac{2\pi}{L}n
\f]
where \f$L\f$ is the length of the box along the chosen direction, \f$n\f$ 
is the number of periods (i.e., layers) per unit cell, \f$W\f$ is a 
dimensionless interfacial width, \f$A_{i}\f$ is a prefactor that can have
different values for different atom types, and \f$\lambda\f$ is an overall
prefactor.

In the parameter field the parameter \f$A_{i}\f$ is denoted by an array
variable named "prefactor", the overall prefactor \f$\lambda\f$ is given
by a parameter "externalParameter", the width parameter \f$W\f$ is named 
"interfaceWidth", the integer n is named "periodicity" and the Cartesian 
axis index is is given by an integer "perpDirection" which can be 0, 1, 
or 2.
  
The parameter file format for LamellarOrderExternal is
\code
   perpDirection       int
   prefactor           Array<float>
   externalParameter   float
   interfaceWidth      float
   periodicity         int
\endcode
where prefactor is an array in column form. For example, an input file
for a system with two atom types (e.g., a diblock copolymer) to induce
four layers along the x (index 0) direction might look like:
\code
   perpDirection         0
   prefactor            -1.0
                         1.0
   externalParameter     0.2
   interfaceWidth        0.1
   periodicity           4
\endcode
