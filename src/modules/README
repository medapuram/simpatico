Each subdirectory of src/modules contains code that was developed 
to allow Simpatico to be used for a specific application, and that 
was deemed too specialized to include in the main mcMd namespace.
Each such directory may have subdirectories containing subclasses 
of Diagnostic, McMove or other base classes defined in Simpatico, 
along with associated factory classes. Each may also define a 
module class or classes for Mc and/or Md simulation (which are 
subclasses of MdModule and/or McModule), and should provide main 
program(s) for MC and/or MD simulation that add these relevant 
module to the main simulation object before reading the parameter 
file.
