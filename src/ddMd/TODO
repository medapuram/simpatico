Exchanger
---------

- Add memory usage statistics, to see which communication step (atom
  exchange or ghost exchange) uses the most memory.

- Write separate algorithm for initial ghost exchange, to reduce memory 
  requirements See doc/notes/ddMd/initGhosts

- Consider moving allocation of Buffer to Exchanger.

Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Modify Cell::OffsetArray object to use strips of cells, to allow efficient 
  use of smaller cells.

- Modify OffsetArray to include all cells for which the closest corner is 
  within the pair list cutoff.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to
  allow for deforming boundaries (requires further changes to Boundary).

Buffer:
-------

- Allocate in bytes, remove atomCapacity and ghostCapacity 
  (see doc/notes/ddMd/Buffer)

Moving GroupStorage to Potential class:
---------------------------------------

- Make each GroupStorage a member of the associated potential.

- see doc/notes/ddMd/GroupStorage

Hybrid MD
---------

- Finish and test transactions in AtomStorage (in transactions branch).

- Add transactions to GroupStorage (in transactions branch).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable single 
  processor operation with no MPI.

Atom
----

- Add speciesId, moleculeId, localId to each atom.

Files
-----

- Modify default file format to store speciesId, moleculeId, molAtomId indices.

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Testing
-------

- Test angle and dihedral stress calculations more thoroughly.
