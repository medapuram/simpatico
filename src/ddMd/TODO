Exchanger:
----------

- Add memory usage statistics, to see which communication step (atom
  exchange or ghost exchange) uses the most memory.

- Write separate algorithm for initial ghost exchange, to reduce memory 
  requirements See doc/notes/ddMd/initGhosts

- Consider moving allocation of Buffer to Exchanger.

Non-orthogonal boundaries:
--------------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to
  allow for non-orthogonal boundaries (requires changes to Boundary).

- Modify calculation of distances between cells in construction of Offset
  array in DdMd::CellList. Perhaps move calculation to Boundary class.

Buffer:
-------

- Allocate in bytes, remove atomCapacity and ghostCapacity 
  (see doc/notes/ddMd/Buffer)

- Make sure memory statistics include all usage, including setup.

AtomStorage:
------------

- Make sure memory statistics include all usage, including setup, so
  that the user has a better indication of when the ghost capacity 
  needs to be increased.

Moving GroupStorage to Potential class:
---------------------------------------

- see doc/notes/ddMd/GroupStorage

- Make each GroupStorage a member of the associated potential.

Hybrid MD
---------

- Finish and test transactions in AtomStorage (in transactions branch).

- Add transactions to GroupStorage (in transactions branch).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable single 
  processor operation with no MPI.

Files
-----

- Add ConfigIo that can read and write hoomd XML format.

- Add mechanism to output trajectory files in a standard format.

- Add ConfigIo that can read and write McMd format, to allow McMd 
  codes to be used for analysis.

- Think about separating topology and configuration files. 

Analysis
--------

- Write stand-alone single processor framework for analysis.
