Testing
-------

- Fix CellTest 

- Fix obsolete PairPotentialTest (change interface for PairPotential)

- Test angle and dihedral stress calculations.

Initial Ghost Exchange
----------------------

- Add exchangeGhosts method to AtomDistributor that distributes the 
  groups among neighboring processors without sending many unnecessary 
  ghosts (to decrease memory requirements).

Dynamic Resizing
----------------

- Allow for dynamic resizing of Storage classes.
  For AtomStorage, must emit signal to reset pointers to atoms.

- Allow for dynamic resizing of Buffer class.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to 
  allow for deforming boundaries (requires further changes to Boundary).

Restart
-------

- Add ddMd restart capability, based on save / load methods. 

Hybrid MD
---------

- Finish and test transactions in AtomStorage (in transactions branch).

- Add transactions to GroupStorage (in transactions branch).

Distributor and Collector:
--------------------------

- Remove association with Domain, remove explicit use of domain communicator.

- Require that setup method be called on all processors, and that it take
  as a parameters a communicator, a rank for the root processor, and ranks
  begin and end for processors that represent spatial domains, which lie 
  in the range begin <= rank < end.

Buffer:
-------

- Change envelope sent with block to contain:

  sendSize_
  sendTimeSize_
  sendItemType_
  isComplete_

  For groups, add enumerations BOND, ANGLE, DIHEDRAL and
  use Type = Buffer::BOND + N - 2 in templates for Group<N>. 

- In beginSendBlock() method, add parametr itemSize and remove 
  parameter groupSize.

- Make pack/unpack methods public. 

- Add public methods to endPackItem() and endUnpackItem(), to
  increment counters. These can check cursor against expected 
  position, based on itemSize and item counters.

- Check cursor against end of block in unpack method template.

- Move pack/unpack methods to methods of Atom and Group classes.

- Add values INT, DOUBLE, VECTOR to enumeration of types.

Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Make AtomTag struct a public class, add an IntVector of micro-cell 
  indices to CellTag, to allow fast rejection of most pairs.

- Modify Cell::getNeighbors method to pass back a list of AtomTag objects, 
  rather than an array of pointers. Provide a CellList method to decide if 
  a particular pair is within the cutoff.

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes 
  to work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable 
  single processor operation with no MPI.

Files
-----

- Think about separating topology and configuration files.
