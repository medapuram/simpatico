Testing
-------

- Fix CellTest 

- Fix obsolete PairPotentialTest (change interface for PairPotential)

- Test angle and dihedral stress calculations.

Initial Ghost Exchange
----------------------

- Add initExchangeGhosts method to DdMd::Exchanger that distributes the 
  groups among neighboring processors without sending many unnecessary 
  ghosts (to decrease memory requirements).

Cell List and Pair List:
------------------------

- Modify Cell::OffsetArray object to use strips of cells, to allow 
  efficient use of smaller cells.

- Modify OffsetArray to include all cells for which the closest corner
  is within the pair list cutoff.

Flexible Unit Cells:
--------------------

- Generalize makeSnapShot and needsExchange methods in AtomStorage to 
  allow for deforming boundaries (requires further changes to Boundary).

Buffer:
-------

- Change envelope sent with block to contain:

  sendSize_
  sendTimeSize_
  sendItemType_
  isComplete_

  For groups, add enumerations BOND, ANGLE, DIHEDRAL and
  use Type = Buffer::BOND + N - 2 in templates for Group<N>. 

- In beginSendBlock() method, add parametr itemSize and remove 
  parameter groupSize.

- Make pack/unpack methods public. 

- Add public methods to endPackItem() and endUnpackItem(), to
  increment counters. These can check cursor against expected 
  position, based on itemSize and item counters.

- Check cursor against end of block in unpack method template.

- Move pack/unpack methods to methods of Atom and Group classes.

- Add values INT, DOUBLE, VECTOR to enumeration of types.

Dynamic Resizing
----------------

- Allow for dynamic resizing of Storage classes.
  For AtomStorage, must emit signal to reset pointers to atoms.

Hybrid MD
---------

- Finish and test transactions in AtomStorage (in transactions branch).

- Add transactions to GroupStorage (in transactions branch).

Single Processor Operation
--------------------------

- Modify Distributor, Collector, ConfigIo, and Exchanger classes to 
  work ifndef UTIL_MPI, continue with other classes, to enable single 
  processor operation with no MPI.

Atom
----

- Add speciesId, moleculeId, localId to each atom.

Files
-----

- Modify default file format to store speciesId, moleculeId, molAtomId indices.

- Think about separating topology and configuration files.
