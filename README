Simpatico is a C++ package for Molecular Dynamics (MD), Monte Carlo (MC), 
and hybrid MC simulations of classical mechanical models of polymeric and
molecular liquids. It contains:

- A program for parallel MD simulations, named ddSim.

- Programs for Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) 
  simulations on a single processor, named mcSim and mdSim.

The parallel MD program ddSim uses a spatial domain decomposition for 
parallelization.
   
Getting the Source Code:
------------------------

Simpatico source code may be obtained either by downloading a compressed
tar file from the github project web page

<http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html> 

or by using git to clone the github repository from the repository page
                                                                             
<https://github.com/dmorse/simpatico>.

Either method gets you a current copy of the master branch from the git 
repository. 

If you download a tarball, the tar file will be named something like 
dmorse-simpatico-id.tar, where "id" denotes a denotes a hexadecimal 
identifier for the most recent commit to the git repository.  When you 
extract the tar file (tar -xvf), the source files will be extracted into 
a directory with the same name, dmorse-simpatico-id/.  To recreate the 
same directory structure as that used in the repository, in which the 
root directory is named simpatico/, you may want to rename this root 
directory to simpatico/, before running the ./setup script.  To unpack 
the tar file and move the directory, enter:

   > tar -xvf dmorse-simpatico-id.tar
   > mv  dmorse-simpatico-id simpatico

from the parent directory that will contain the simpatico root directory. 
If you move the root directory after running the setup script (see below), 
you must rerun the setup script. 

Documentation:
--------------

Web pages that provide both user and developer documentation for 
Simpatico is prepared using the Doxygen utility (www.doxygen.org).  
Doxygen creates html web pages that are deposited in the directory 
doc/html/ of the working tree. These pages are created from comments 
extracted from the C++ source code, and from a set of text files in the 
directory doc/manual/. These text files, which have the file extension 
*.dox, contain the text for a set of introductory documentation pages, 
and are readable in any text editor. 

A recent copy of the documentation is available online, at

<http://dmorse.github.com/simpatico/index.html>.

After getting a copy of the source code (either by download or by 
cloning the git repository), you can use dOxygen to generate a local 
copy of the html documentation within the simpatico/doc/html directory 
of the source code tree.  This requires that dOxygen be installed on 
your computer and that the executable be in a directory in your PATH. 
The basic instructions (after dOxygen is installed) are:

  - cd to the simpatico/doc directory

  - Enter "make html"

This should create many html files in the simpatico/doc/html 
directory. To begin reading the documentation, point a browser at 
the file simpatico/doc/html/index.html, which is the main page.

Compiling:
----------

The code is ansi standard C++ and must be compiled from source. 
Multi-processor programs (ddSim and multi-processor versions of 
mcSim and mdSim) also require an MPI library. The build system 
requires the gnu version of the unix make utility and a python
interpreter.

Complete instructions for compiling various versions of Simpatico 
are given in the text file simpatico/doc/manual/user/compile.dox, 
or in the corresponding html web page in the doc/html directory.
Short instructions for compiling the default single-processor 
versions of mcSim and mdSim (for the impatient) are:

- Add the simpatico/bin directory to your linux command search
  PATH environment variable, and add the simpatico/tools/python 
  directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

- cd to the simpatico/ root directory

- Enter "./setup" from this root directory to run a setup script

- Enter "make mcMd" from the same directory

The resulting executables, named "mcSim" and "mdSim", will be 
installed in the simpatico bin/ directory. Please see the text 
file and html documentation mentioned above for further 
instructions for compiling multi-processor programs, which may 
require modification of the users programming environment and/or 
simpatico configuration files to provide access to an MPI 
library.  

Instructions for enabling or disabling a variety of optional 
compile-time features are also given in the html documentation.
